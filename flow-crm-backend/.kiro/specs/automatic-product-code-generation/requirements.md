# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements automatic generation of product codes in the backend system, eliminating the need for manual code definition. The system will generate unique, sequential codes following the pattern "PROD" + 7 sequential numeric digits with zero-padding (e.g., PROD0000001, PROD0000002).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want product codes to be generated automatically when creating new products, so that I don't need to manually assign codes and can ensure uniqueness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new product is created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a unique code before saving to the database
2. WHEN generating a product code THEN the system SHALL use the format "PROD" + 7 zero-padded sequential digits
3. WHEN the first product is created THEN the system SHALL generate code "PROD0000001"
4. WHEN subsequent products are created THEN the system SHALL increment the numeric sequence (PROD0000002, PROD0000003, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the product code generation to handle concurrent requests safely, so that no duplicate codes are created when multiple products are added simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple products are created concurrently THEN the system SHALL ensure each receives a unique code
2. WHEN a code generation conflict occurs THEN the system SHALL retry with the next available sequence number
3. WHEN determining the next sequence number THEN the system SHALL query the database for the highest existing code
4. IF no products exist THEN the system SHALL start the sequence at "PROD0000001"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want product codes to be immutable after creation, so that product references remain consistent throughout the system lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product is created THEN the code field SHALL be set as read-only
2. WHEN attempting to update a product code THEN the system SHALL reject the modification
3. WHEN displaying product information THEN the code SHALL be visible but not editable
4. WHEN validating product updates THEN the system SHALL ignore any code field changes in the request

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the code generation to be reliable and handle edge cases, so that the system remains stable under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sequence reaches PROD9999999 THEN the system SHALL handle the maximum limit gracefully
2. WHEN database errors occur during code generation THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN existing products have non-standard codes THEN the system SHALL still generate valid sequential codes for new products
4. WHEN the code generation process fails THEN the product creation SHALL be rolled back completely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code generation logic to be integrated seamlessly into the existing product creation flow, so that no breaking changes are introduced to the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a product via API THEN the code field SHALL be optional in the request payload
2. WHEN a code is provided in the request THEN the system SHALL ignore it and generate a new one
3. WHEN the product is successfully created THEN the response SHALL include the generated code
4. WHEN validating product creation requests THEN existing validation rules SHALL remain unchanged except for code field requirements

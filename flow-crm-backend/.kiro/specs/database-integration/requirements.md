# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Database Integration feature focuses on connecting the Flow CRM Backend to a live PostgreSQL database, replacing the current mock data setup with real database operations. This includes running database migrations, establishing proper database connections, and ensuring all services operate with persistent data storage. The system currently has all the database schemas, ORM configuration, and service logic ready, but needs the actual database connection and migration execution to become fully operational.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to execute database migrations, so that all required tables and schemas are created in the PostgreSQL database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the migration command THEN the system SHALL create all required database tables (users, customers, products, presales, presale_items)
2. WHEN migrations are executed THEN the system SHALL apply all constraints, indexes, and relationships defined in the schemas
3. WHEN migrations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL log confirmation of successful table creation
4. IF migrations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the failure reason
5. WHEN I check the database THEN the system SHALL have all tables with proper column types and constraints
6. WHEN migrations run multiple times THEN the system SHALL not duplicate tables or cause conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to connect to the PostgreSQL database on startup, so that all API operations use persistent data storage instead of mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database using the DATABASE_URL
2. WHEN the database connection is established THEN the system SHALL log successful connection confirmation
3. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and prevent application startup
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly close database connections
5. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling for efficiency
6. WHEN the database plugin is registered THEN the system SHALL make the database connection available to all services

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service operations to use real database queries, so that data persists between application restarts and API calls work with actual data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a customer THEN the system SHALL store the data in the PostgreSQL customers table
2. WHEN I retrieve customers THEN the system SHALL query the database and return actual stored data
3. WHEN I update customer information THEN the system SHALL modify the database record and persist changes
4. WHEN I delete a customer THEN the system SHALL remove the record from the database
5. WHEN I perform product operations THEN the system SHALL interact with the products table in the database
6. WHEN I manage pre-sales THEN the system SHALL store and retrieve data from presales and presale_items tables
7. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL validate users against the users table in the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify database connectivity and health, so that I can ensure the system is operating correctly with the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check database health THEN the system SHALL provide a way to test the database connection
2. WHEN the database is healthy THEN the system SHALL return successful connection status
3. IF the database is unreachable THEN the system SHALL report connection failure with diagnostic information
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL perform an initial database health check
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages for troubleshooting
6. WHEN I query the database directly THEN the system SHALL have all expected tables and data structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for database operations, so that the application gracefully handles database-related issues and provides useful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database query fails THEN the system SHALL catch the error and return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL return specific validation error messages
3. WHEN the database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and log the issue
4. WHEN database timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing the application
5. WHEN duplicate key violations occur THEN the system SHALL return user-friendly error messages
6. WHEN foreign key constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear error information
